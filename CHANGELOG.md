+ [#180](https://github.com/danfickle/openhtmltopdf/issues/180) Fast renderer is finally ready for production. The fast renderer comes with:

  + Improved performance. This renderer scales linearly with the number of pages, compared to the old renderer which scaled with the page count squared.
  + Far better support for transforms, including nested transforms, multiple transforms and transforms interacting with hidden overflow, etc.
  + Better support for hidden overflow, with boxes now not escaping except with accordance to the standard.
  + Support for inserted cut off overflow pages. See [Cut-off page support](https://github.com/danfickle/openhtmltopdf/wiki/Cut-off-page-support) on the wiki.
  + Link areas and their hash link targets now repect transforms.
  + Bookmark targets now respect transforms.
  + Improved page placement for boxes. Now respects overflow and tranform properties.
  + Greater understanding which should make fixes and feature improvements easier.

### 0.0.1-RC17
+ [#284](https://github.com/danfickle/openhtmltopdf/pull/284) [#288](https://github.com/danfickle/openhtmltopdf/issues/288) IMPORTANT: This release was brought forward due to a CVE in Apache Batik used by the optional SVG module.
  While this project strongly advises not to use untrusted XML either in SVG or XHTML, you may be using Batik in another part of your project and therefore it is a good idea to update. Thanks a lot @ghenadiibatalski, @chubbard
+ [#286](https://github.com/danfickle/openhtmltopdf/issues/286) [#281](https://github.com/danfickle/openhtmltopdf/issues/281) Fix for text decorations/background incorrect coverage in justified text. Thanks @koritakoa, @allartammik

+ [#279](https://github.com/danfickle/openhtmltopdf/pull/279) [#264](https://github.com/danfickle/openhtmltopdf/pull/264)
IMPORTANT: This release was brought forward so that we link against PDFBOX-2.0.12 as previous versions had another DOS security vulnerability when parsing arbitary PDF files. Also there was a security issue in the old version of JSoup used by the optional jsoup-dom-converter module.
  While I believe these vulnerabilities should not impact this project directly, having an insecure library on your classpath may be dangerous if you use it for other tasks.
